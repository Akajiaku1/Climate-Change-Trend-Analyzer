🌍 Climate Change Trend Analyzer

Climate Change Trend Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and visualize trends in global climate indicators, including temperature anomalies, CO₂ emissions, and sea level rise. By leveraging linear regression and data visualization techniques, this tool aids researchers, educators, and policymakers in understanding the progression of climate change over time.
📊 Features

    Trend Analysis: Applies linear regression to identify trends in climate data.

    Visualization: Generates line charts to depict observed data alongside trend lines.

    Modular Design: Structured codebase for easy extension and maintenance.

    Data Flexibility: Compatible with various datasets in CSV format.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

📈 Usage

    Prepare Your Data

    Ensure your CSV files are formatted as follows:

        Temperature Anomalies (global_temp_anomaly.csv)

Year,Anomaly
1880,-0.12
1881,-0.10
...
2023,1.10

CO₂ Emissions (co2_emissions.csv)

Year,CO2
1960,9.4
1961,9.6
...
2023,36.8

Sea Level Rise (sea_level.csv)

    Year,Sea_Level
    1993,0.0
    1994,0.3
    ...
    2023,9.2

Run the Analyzer

    python analyzer.py

    The script will:

        Load each dataset.

        Perform linear regression to identify trends.

        Display line charts with observed data and trend lines.

        Output the linear trend equations to the console.
